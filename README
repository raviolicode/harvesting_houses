SCRAPING HOUSES
========================================================================

This gem scrapes from housing listings in Uruguay into a sqlite database.

To try it: 
$ ruby main.rb

Test:
$ rspec test/bc_scraper.rb


How it works:
========================================================================
At the moment, it only scrapes BuscandoCasa.com. 

Config Files:
========================================================================
config/scraping_data.yml:
  This file has all the parameters scraped for a particular house
  For each parameter, it is needed an xpath and an index. This is needed
for now, because the HTML scraped is malformed. 

config/urls.yml:
  This file contains the urls needed to access the site


========================================================================
